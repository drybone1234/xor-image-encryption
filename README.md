## 💻 System Requirements

- **Operating Systems:** Windows, macOS, and Linux are supported.
- **Memory:** At least 512 MB of RAM.
- **Disk Space:** Approximately 100 MB of free space.
- **Python:** Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system to run this tool.

## ⚙️ Features

- **XOR Encryption:** This tool uses XOR encryption to keep your images safe.
- **Seed-Based Key Generation:** Generate keys based on a seed for added security.
- **RGB Pixel-Level Encryption:** Each pixel can be encrypted independently.
- **Histogram Analysis:** Understand your image data better with built-in analysis tools.
- **Multi-Seed Operations:** Work with multiple seeds to enhance security.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Launch the Application:** After downloading, open the application.
  
2. **Select an Image:** Click on "Select Image" to choose the file you want to encrypt or decrypt.

3. **Enter Seed:** Input a seed value. This seed will dictate your encryption key.

4. **Choose Operation:** Select either "Encrypt" or "Decrypt."

5. **Output Options:** Choose where you want to save the resulting image. You can save it in the same folder or specify a new location.

6. **Run the Process:** Click on "Process" to begin encryption or decryption.

7. **View Results:** Once completed, check the output directory for your secured image.

## 📊 Understanding Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting information into a secure format. This application uses a simple yet effective method called XOR encryption. 

- **How does it work?** XOR encryption takes two inputs: your image data and a key derived from the seed. This method ensures that only those with the seed can decrypt the image.
